# macOS catalina beta on Lenovo ThinkPad T480s

This repository is a working progress of the clover folder used to install catalina beta on a Lenovo ThinkPad T480s.
I started with https://github.com/linusyang92/macOS-ThinkPad-T480s and realised that an update to catalina beta results in a kernel panic. After some testing I found that the VirtualSMC.kext prevents the installation. So this clover folder excludes this file.

I AM RUNNING BETA 5 ATM. BLUETOOTH DOES NOT CONNECT BUT THE ISSUE ALSO APPEARS ON MY MACBOOK AIR SO IT IS NOT SPECIFIC TO HACKINTOSH. IF YOU ARE DEPENDENT ON BLUETOOTH, STAY WITH BETA 4.

## Used Hardware Configuration

- Lenovo ThinkPad T480s (20L8S02D00)
  - Intel i5-8250U
  - 8GB RAM onboard + 8GB Crucial DDR4 2400-SODIMM
  - Samsung 970 evo NVMe 1TB SSD
  - Dell DW1830 Wireless (original Intel AC8265 not working)
  - WQHD display
  - HD Audio Realtek ALC3287

## Working at this point

- WQHD resolution
- WiFi (Dell DW1830)
- Bluetooth (Dell DW1830)
- Ethernet (wired)
- Sound
- Fix for the trackpad pref https://kaykun.net/hf/Trackpad.zip (credit @KayKun from hackintosh-forum.de)
- By plugging in an Apple Trackpad 2 via USB I was able to get into the trackpad preference menu (even after unplugging it afterwards). This is only a temporary fix as it is reverted after a restart.

## Issues

- Plugging in an external display via USB-C (thunderbolt 3) results in reboot
- Trackpad pref can not be accessed in system Preferences ("Could not load Trackpad preference pane.")
- probably many more that I do not know of yet ...
